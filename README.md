Lesson 14

Let's say there is a file with document numbers.
The document number is a string consisting of letters and numbers (without service characters).
Let this file contain each document number on a new line and no other information on the line, only the document number.
A valid document number must be 15 characters long and begin with the sequence docnum (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers) or contract (hereinafter any sequence of letters/numbers).
*Write a program to read information from an input file - the path to the input file must be specified via the console.
*The program must check document numbers for validity.
*Valid document numbers docnum should be recorded in one report file.
*Valid contract numbers should be recorded in another report file.
Errors, if they occur, should be recorded in the error_log.txt file
Logs should be written to the file execution_log.txt
Invalid document numbers should be recorded in another report file, but after the document numbers you should add information about why this document is invalid (incorrect sequence of characters at the beginning/there are service characters in the document name, etc.).
